<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
<h3>Project # 1</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Client:Montgomery</li> 
	<li>Software:Micro station </li>
	<li>Role:data capturing, Conversion</li>
	<li>Team Size: 15</li>
</ul>
<h3>Description:</h3>	
<p>This project aims at migration of 3D planimetric data from design file to geo-database.<br/>
   Initially the design file data consisting of transportation features, hydrological features,<br/>
   building features and vegetation data was updated in 3D using photogrammetry software.<br/>
   The updated features were divided into blocks for convenience and were converted to individual geo-database files.<br/>
   All the topological errors such as dangles; label errors were checked in AutoCad.<br/>
   Then attributes were linked so as to differentiate the old and updated data. Finally, the data was sent to the client in geo-database format<br/>
</p>
<h3>Project # 2</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Client:Prince George County</li> 
	<li>Software:Micro station </li>
	<li>Role:data capturing, Conversion</li>
	<li>Team Size: 20</li>
</ul>
<h3>Description:</h3>	
<p>This Project is purely updation project. The main objective of the project is to collect the planimetric features like roads, buildings, driveways,<br/>
     parking lots, rivers, ditches etc., <br/>
     All the compiled data is referenced to original client provided geo-database and updating the features and attributions accordingly. Finally, <br/>
    topological errors validated and metadata information as per the client requirements<br/>
